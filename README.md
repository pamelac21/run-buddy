## User Story
```md
`AS A member of a busy family`
`I WANT to have a place where I can communicate with a limited group of people`
`SO THAT we can organize, plan and share with each other in a platform with limited distractions`
```

## Description
A simple viewer application to manage and view the activities of every member of your family. 

Do you need help managing the day to day activities for your family? Do you find it challenging to stay on top of
the kids events? Or how about sharing photos/videos while away? Well, we’ve created a simple app that allows
you to view the activities of every member of your family. This app provides a simple-looking front end calendar
template. Each member of the family will have the ability to view, post, update and delete day to day activities.
We’ve eliminated many of the distractions that come with downloading similar applications. No more targeted
advertisements. No more signing up for trials just to later pay a membership fee to use a similar app. With the
FAMILY app, each member of the family has equal access to view everyone’s schedules, and share
photos/videos uploaded by other family members. We’re the solution you’ve been looking for. The Family app
will exponentially decrease the stress of weekly family planning.
